Flask application with Celery using Test-Driven Development (TDD):

```
/myapp
    /job_queue
        __init__.py
        /src
            /main
                __init__.py
                app.py
                celery_config.py
            /tasks
                __init__.py
                mytasks.py
        /tests
            __init__.py
            /unit
                __init__.py
                test_app.py
                test_tasks.py
            /integration
                __init__.py
                test_app_integration.py
    run.py
    run_celery.py
    requirements.txt
```

Here's what each file/directory is for:

- `/myapp`: The outer myapp directory is the root of your project.
- `/myapp/job_queue`: This is the actual Python module of your application.
- `/myapp/job_queue/src`: This directory holds your source code.
- `/myapp/job_queue/src/main`: This directory includes the main Flask application and Celery configuration.
- `/myapp/job_queue/src/tasks`: This directory includes the Celery tasks.
- `/myapp/job_queue/tests`: This directory includes all the test cases.
- `/myapp/job_queue/tests/unit`: This directory includes all the unit tests.
- `/myapp/job_queue/tests/integration`: This directory includes all the integration tests.
- `run.py`: This script runs your application.
- `run_celery.py`: This script runs your Celery worker.
- `requirements.txt`: This file lists all of the Python packages that your app depends on.

You could run your tests using a library like `pytest` with the following command:

```bash
pytest myapp/tests
```

This structure separates the main application and tasks from the test suite, providing a clean organization for a TDD project.
